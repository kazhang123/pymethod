# MILESTONES

## Milestone 1:
This week we've been trying to narrow down potential ideas for project 2. So far we've come up with the following ideas:
- Control flow visualizer with added features (ie runtime analyses)
- Extrating a UML class diagram from class hierarchy in a dynamic programming language such as python

Our planned follow up tasks for next week include:
- Continuing to research / narrow down on project ideas
- Get feedback from Jifeng on our findings
