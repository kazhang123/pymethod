# MILESTONES

## Milestone 1:
This week we've been trying to narrow down potential ideas for project 2. So far we've come up with the following ideas:
- Control flow visualizer with added features (i.e runtime analyses)
- Extracting a UML class diagram from class hierarchy in a dynamic programming language such as python

Our current favourite is:
A dynamic centrality diagram that visualises the centrality of classes given some execution. For example, a function in a loop will be analysed so that the our program tracks the number of times it was called. The program will produce a centrality graph where the nodes represent the classes, and the edges represent how much dependency there is between some nodes. A blue edge will mean that there is minimal dependency, and a red node means that there is a lot of dependency. The user can also click on the nodes to get information about how much a given class was used by some other class, how much time was spent in some class for a given execution, how many classes were made to its classes, etc. Our target language is Java. 

Our planned follow up tasks for next week include:
- Continuing to research / narrow down on project ideas
- Get feedback from Jifeng on our findings
